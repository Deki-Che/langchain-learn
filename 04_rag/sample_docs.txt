LangChain 1.0 Overview

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. 
The framework was released in October 2022 and has quickly become one of the most popular tools for building LLM applications.

Key Features:
- LCEL (LangChain Expression Language): A declarative way to compose chains using the pipe operator.
- Modular Components: Prompts, Models, Output Parsers, Memory, and more.
- RAG Support: Built-in tools for Retrieval Augmented Generation.
- Agent Framework: Create autonomous agents that can use tools.

Version 1.0 Changes:
The major update to version 1.0 introduced breaking changes but significantly improved the developer experience.
The new LCEL syntax replaced the old Chain classes like LLMChain and ConversationChain.
Memory management was redesigned with RunnableWithMessageHistory.

Use Cases:
LangChain is used for chatbots, document analysis, code generation, data extraction, and autonomous agents.
Companies use it to build internal knowledge bases and customer support systems.

Installation:
You can install LangChain using pip: pip install langchain
For OpenAI integration: pip install langchain-openai
For community integrations: pip install langchain-community
